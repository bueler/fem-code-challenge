==================

Matlab codes and documentation related to 2005 seminar "The Math 692 one-page Matlab FEM code challenge".  That material is still online (and not version-controlled) at

[The Math 692 one-page Matlab FEM code challenge](http://www.dms.uaf.edu/~bueler/challenge.htm)

These historical codes are subject to bit rot, so don't be surprised if recent Matlab has different behavior.
