fem-code-challenge
==================

Matlab codes and documentation related to 2005 seminar "The Math 692 one-page Matlab FEM code challenge".

These historical codes are subject to bit rot.  In particular, some short names like "heat.m" were unwise and other codes with that name may have clobbered them.  (I.e. that could have happened _before_ I moved this stuff to a nice git repo!  Recall git was invented in 2005.)
