==================

Matlab codes and documentation related to 2005 seminar "The Math 692 one-page Matlab FEM code challenge".  That material is at

[The Math 692 one-page Matlab FEM code challenge](http://bueler.github.io/M692F04/challenge.htm)

These historical codes are subject to bit rot, so don't be surprised if recent Matlab has different behavior.
